### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

Flutter developer based in Tokyo and currently an undergraduate at Waseda University. 

I manage several Flutter packages and I'm so happy that they're used by many developers.

If you have any requests or problems, please do not hesitate to open an issue or pull request.

I'll do my best to keep the packages updated, but please understand that my responses and updates may be delayed at times due to my other commitments.

Thank you.
