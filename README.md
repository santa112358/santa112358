### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

Flutter developer based in Tokyo, and underdraduate in Waseda university.

I am managing several flutter packages and so happy that many developers are using them.

If you have any requests or problems, please do not hesitate to open an issue or pull request.

I do my best to update them, but sometimes my response and updates can be slow due to the projects I am involved in.

Thank you.
